      <h4 id="howWeDoThis">How we do this</h4>
      <div>
      <p>Often, vertical channel conflict (i.e. between layers of supply chain) occurs due to ambiguous roles and
         responsibilities.<br><br>
      </p>
      </div>
      <div id="more1">
      <p>
         With a clear definition of roles and responsibilities, our Synchronization process starts
         by making sure that all supply chain partners are fully aware what tasks they’re expected to perform
         (e.g. storing goods, modifying, reassemble, price marking), when they’re expected to do them
         (e.g. lead-times and deadlines).<br><br>
         How they’re expected to perform (e.g. to what operating specifications) and what results are expected
         (e.g. sales quota, customer satisfaction ratings).<br><br>
         For us it’s simple, we collaborate with our clients, evaluate roles & business functions and devise a plan
         (we call this our blueprint) to get all of our client’s partners (both internal & external) operating in a
         manner that is mutually supportive (flexible & cooperative) and seamless (smooth & unnoticed by customers).<br><br>
         Every business wants more productivity from less input, thus for effective Supply Chain tasks and activities
         require operating synchronization such as entering orders, conforming schedules, tracking shipments,
         communicating status information, invoicing, collecting payments, processing returns, resolving disputes, etc.<br><br>
         Teamire understands the level of pain whenever a client’s partner has a process failure, the entire supply
         chain may be disrupted. These types of process failures among partners can lead to annoying operational
         conflict resulting in businesses suffering financial losses, allowing for un-announced competition and this is
         where TEAMIRE can step in to help you find the right solution to your problems.

         What separate us from the competition is our ability to find, plan and deploy seasoned and talented Supply Chain
         subject matter experts on project every time. Many of these refined individuals are experts who miss out simply
         due to lack of opportunity. Through our internal training programs, we continue to work with our members to further
         develop their project management skills in producing optimal results for every project. Whilst providing these
         subject matter experts a platform is expensive the benefit we receive as a result far outweigh the cost associated
         in preparing them to deliver at the highest level.<br><br>
