                                    <i>“Our greatest asset is Teamire’s members/contractors”, he says. “we never place any kind of

                            <h4>How We Do This</h4>
                            <div>
                                <p>Often, vertical channel conflict (i.e. between layers of supply chain) occurs due to ambiguous
                                    roles and
                                    responsibilities.
                                    With a clear definition of roles and responsibilities, our Synchronization process starts
                                    by making sure that all supply chain partners are fully aware what tasks they’re expected to
                                    perform
                                    (e.g. storing goods, modifying, reassemble, price marking), when they’re expected to do them
                                    (e.g. lead-times and deadlines).<br><br>
                                    How they’re expected to perform (e.g. to what operating specifications) and what results are
                                    expected
                                    (e.g. sales quota, customer satisfaction ratings).
                                    For us it’s simple, we collaborate with our clients, evaluate roles & business functions and
                                    devise a plan
                                    (we call this our blueprint) to get all of our client’s partners (both internal & external)
                                    operating in a
                                    manner that is mutually supportive (flexible & cooperative) and seamless (smooth & unnoticed by
                                    customers).<br><br>
                                    Every business wants more productivity from less input, thus for effective Supply Chain tasks
                                    and activities
                                    require operating synchronization such as entering orders, conforming schedules, tracking
                                    shipments,
                                    communicating status information, invoicing, collecting payments, processing returns, resolving
                                    disputes, etc.<br><br>
                                    Teamire understands the level of pain whenever a client’s partner has a process failure, the
                                    entire supply
                                    chain may be disrupted. These types of process failures among partners can lead to annoying
                                    operational
                                    conflict resulting in businesses suffering financial losses, allowing for un-announced
                                    competition and this is
                                    where TEAMIRE can step in to help you find the right solution to your problems.
